The island which I remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, heavily timbered, and lay near the Kentucky shoreâ€”within two hundred yards of it, I should say.

Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and this was no longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against the opposite shore, a mile away. In war times the island had been an important place, for it commanded the situation; and, being heavily fortified, there was no getting by it. It lay between the upper and lower divisions of the Union forces, and kept them separate, until a junction was finally effected across the Missouri neck of land; but the island being itself joined to that neck now, the wide river is without obstruction.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In this region the river passes from Kentucky into Tennessee, back into Missouri, then back into</p></div> </div>
