<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">original is before me, now, and I here append it. It is pretty well loaded with internal evidence of the most solid description—</p><p>STATE'S PRISON, CHAPLAIN'S OFFICE, July 11, 1873.</p><p><em>Dear Bro. Page</em>,—Herewith please find the letter kindly loaned me. I am afraid its genuineness cannot be established. It purports to be addressed to some prisoner here. No such letter ever came to a prisoner here. All letters received are carefully read by officers of the prison before they go into the hands of the convicts, and any such letter could not be forgotten. Again, Charles Williams is not a Christian man, but a dissolute, cunning prodigal, whose father is a minister of the gospel. His name is an assumed one. I am glad to have made your acquaintance. I am preparing a lecture upon life seen through prison bars, and should like to deliver the same in your vicinity.</p></div> </div>
