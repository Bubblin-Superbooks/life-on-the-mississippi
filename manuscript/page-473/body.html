<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">George Ealer, and Billy Youngblood—all A-1 alligator pilots. <em>They</em> could tell alligator water as far as another Christian could tell whiskey. Read it?—Ah, <em>couldn't</em> they, though! I only wish I had as many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half off. Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good alligator pilot could always get fifteen hundred dollars a month. Nights, other people had to lay up for alligators, but those fellows never laid up for alligators; they never laid up for anything but fog. They could <em>smell</em> the best alligator water it was said; I don't know whether it was so or not, and I think a body's got his hands full enough if he sticks to just what he knows himself, without going around backing up other people's say-so's, though there's a plenty that ain't backward about doing it, as long as they can roust out something wonderful to tell. Which is not the style of Robert Styles, by as much as three fathom—maybe quarter-<em>less</em>.'</p></div> </div>
