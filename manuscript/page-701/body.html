<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. You know my present way of life. Can you suggest any additions to it, in the way of crime, that will reasonably insure my going to some other place.</p><p>A. No reply.</p><p>Q. When did you die?</p><p>A. I did not die, I passed away.</p><p>Q. Very well, then, when did you pass away? How long have you been in the spirit land?</p><p>A. We have no measurements of time here.</p><p>Q. Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times in your present condition and environment, this has nothing to do with your former condition. You had dates then. One of these is what I ask for. You departed on a certain day in a certain year. Is not this true?</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>Q. Then name the day of the month.</p></div> </div>
